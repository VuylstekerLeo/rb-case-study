## Installation

We used Python 3.10 for this project.

Additionally, we recommend setting up a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
